# MarkTube – Personal YouTube Manager 🎯

Tired of losing track of what you've watched or what you want to revisit on YouTube? **MarkTube** is here to help!

MarkTube is a productivity-focused browser extension designed to help users manage their YouTube watchlist with advanced features like personalized video marking, intelligent categorization, theme customization, and upcoming AI-powered insights.

While the initial idea behind MarkTube was independently conceived, during early research I discovered a similar extension. I took limited UI inspiration and learned from how it handled certain YouTube DOM patterns, which helped accelerate early experimentation.

However, all features, logic, and interface design in MarkTube have been rebuilt from the ground up, with extensive new functionality, better UX, multiple watchlist types, and aims for a scalable architecture for future cross-platform integrations and AI inclusion. Stay tuned for updates on Linkedin And Github Releases.

🚀 **Features:**
- ✅ Mark videos as **Watched**, **Important**, or **Want to Watch**
- 🖼️ Visually enhanced: Colored borders around videos based on status
- 💾 One-click **Backup** and **Restore** your marked videos list
- 🎯 Personal **Watchlist View** for “Want to Watch” videos(Ideally for the ones you want to watch in the very near future like tomorrow or next time you open youtube.)
- 🎨 Simple and minimal UI – built for function, not fluff

🛡️ **No tracking. No auto-updates. No fluff.**
Your data stays local and under your control.

📝 **Version:** `1.2.1`

📁 Download the ZIP, extract, and load it via `chrome://extensions → Load Unpacked`.
